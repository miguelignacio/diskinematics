H1 Event Shape Analysis (MPIM, 2020)
====================================

.. note::  Please keep this README file up-to-date

Package structure
-----------
 
  * `Analysis` contains analysis code 

  * `Analysis/Steering` contains steering files for the analysis

  * `LumiFiles` contains the lumi files

  * ... add more here


How to run
----------
A simple start is obtained by:
 
  * Set up H1 software release 4.1.1:  `cd $H1DIST/lcg_releases/releases/4.1.1; . thish1.sh`. 
    Then go back to your work directory

  * Check out repository `git clone https://<user>@stash.desy.de/scm/h1ana/eventshapesmpim.git`

  * Go to analysis directory `cd eventshapesmpim/Analysis`

  * Compile analysis code `make all`

  * Run a first example with
    ```
    $ ../bin/x86_64-centos7-gcc9-opt/EventShapes -f Steering/es.ep0304dis.steer -n 10000 -o test.root -c DjangoEplus0304_1
    ```



Quick start
-----------
A complete set of control plots with a limited set of MCs, but with all 0304 data is obtained by running

  * `cd Analysis`, make analysis: `make all`

  * run a few jobs locally: `run_test_ep0304.sh`

  * wait for about 2 minutes

  * Merge files: `hadd -f merged.root Test0304Out/*.root`

  * plot files: `root -b -q plot_all.cxx`

.. note: H1 MC's include run-specific information. In this example, the MCs have only a few 
   selected runs, but not the entire run period. Therefore, correct control plots are only obtained
   when processing all MCs for a given runperiod (or alternatively performing a corresponding data selection).
